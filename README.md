# DynamoDB Designer

Visual exploring/testing/playing and database design tool for DynamoDB. Quickly test out different global secondary indexes, execute and build queries, and develop a better understanding of DynamoDB.

### Inspiration

This is the tool I wish I had when I started learning DynamoDB. Learning AWS's wide-column data store has a lot of cognitive overhead, especially coming from a relational database. The learning curve for DynamoDB is steep. This is a visual tool that aims to help bridge the gap between more common database queries (MySQL, Postgres, Mongo) and Dynamo's.
